## Dependencies

- gym
- pyglet

To install the above libraries, run the following command:
'pip3 install gym'
'pip3 install pyglet'

## Code Layout

- The class sarsaAgent holds all the implementation of the agent.The constructor of this class instantiates all the required hyperparamters and weights for the training.
- The get_table_features and get_better_features functions returns feature vectors for task 1 and task 2 respectively.
- The choose_action function takes state, current weights and epsilon as arguments and return a valid action to take.
- sarsa_update function updates the Sarsa weights for Task 1 as well as Task 2. It takes appropriate arguments.
- The save_weights function saves the final weights for the tasks.
- The load_weights function loads and returns the saved weights.
- The train function trains the agent for a certain number of episodes and obtain the data for plotting graphs for the two tasks. 
- The test function loads the saved weights by using the earlier load_weights function and runs 100 episodes and returns the average reward.

## Usage

Run the following command to train the agent:
'python mountain_car.py --task [T1/T2] --train 1'

- The above code only trains the agent and saves the plot and final weights for the tasks. It is not expected to output anything.

After training, run the following command to test the agent:
'python mountain car.py --task [T1/T2] --train 0'

- The above code tests the agent and returns the average reward for the 100 episodes.
